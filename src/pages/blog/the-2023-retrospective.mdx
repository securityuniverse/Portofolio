In this blog post, I dive into a detailed methodology for SQL Injection exploitation using Waybash URLs, a lesser-known but effective technique in the bug bounty field. By leveraging Waybash URLs, bug bounty hunters can uncover vulnerabilities in SQL queries that aren't always apparent through traditional methods.

---

### Key Highlights
- **Background**: An overview of SQL Injection and its impact on web applications.
- **Methodology**: Step-by-step guidance on identifying vulnerable SQL endpoints, using Waybash URLs for exploitation, and documenting findings.
- **Case Study**: A real-world example showcasing how Waybash URLs were utilized to exploit SQL Injection in a live bug bounty program.
